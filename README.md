# hyf-class09-04

This is the code we created on class #4 of NodeJS on the big screen.

### How to start:
- `cd api`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- open the web/index.html in the browser

## Homework

This week your homework have 2 tasks:

### Task 1:
Clean-up your repository (from the previous homework) by splitting it into multiple modules (files) and use require/export. You can see how we did it in the class in this repo and use it as template, **but avoid copy-pasting** - you learn the best if you **do**, not **copy-paste**.

### Task 2:
Add validation logic to `POST /api/mentors` API endpoint - use our in class excercise as an example. Use the npm package we used in class for validation - you need to write schema for Mentors and use the middleware.
